**One-command starter pack: install all 42 PerryLink DeepSeek Harness plugins.**

[dsh-kit](https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-kit) is a curated collection of [PerryLink's DSH plugin family](https://github.com/PerryLink) — the Claude Code parity trio plus the rest of the family, across security, workflows, research, messaging bridges, and developer experience. Each plugin ships with a complete `dsh.bundle` manifest, five-language docs, CI, and npm publishing.

## Quick start

Pick a profile (e.g. `web`), then install everything:

```sh
# Linux / macOS
./install-all.sh web

# Windows PowerShell
.\install-all.ps1 -Profile web
```

Or install individual plugins:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-checkpoint-rewind   # /rewind equivalent
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-permission-rules    # allow/deny/ask rules
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-output-styles       # outputStyles equivalent
```

## What's inside (curated highlights — the installers cover the full 42-plugin family)

| [dsh-claude-move](https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-claude-move) | Migrate Claude Code sessions, memory, skills and CLAUDE.md into DSH |

## Notes

- The installed set is [`plugins.txt`](plugins.txt) — one npm spec per line, and the only place the roster is written down. Both installers read it, and `node scripts/check-parity.mjs` holds them and every count on this page to it.
- Install scripts are **idempotent** — safe to re-run.
- `dsh-skill-pack-security` installs from its published provider package (`@perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider`); everything else installs from npm.
- Versions track the latest npm releases; pin a specific version per plugin if you need reproducibility.
- Deprecated names are not installed: `dsh-plugin-upgrade-015` (and its earlier name `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1`) are superseded by `dsh-plugin-upgrade`, which carries every corridor in one package. They stay on npm for anyone who already installed them.
- License: Apache-2.0 (matching the plugin family).
